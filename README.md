# EmployeeManagement
The Employee Management System is a full-stack application built with Spring Boot microservices on the backend and a React frontend. It is designed to demonstrate how modern web applications can leverage microservice architecture, service-to-service communication, and a responsive UI to manage employee data effectively.

🔧 Tech Stack

Backend:
Spring Boot (Microservice Architecture)
Feign Client for inter-service communication
REST APIs for CRUD operations
(Optional: add details if you used Eureka, API Gateway, or Config Server)

Frontend:
React for building a responsive and dynamic UI
Integration with backend APIs for seamless data flow

🚀 Features

Employee registration, updating, and deletion
Department and employee service separation (microservices)
Service-to-service calls using Feign Client
RESTful API endpoints with clean architecture
Responsive UI built with React
Scalable microservice design for real-world use cases

🏗️ Architecture

Microservices: Backend is divided into independent services (e.g., Employee Service, Department Service)
Feign Client: Enables communication between services without hard dependencies
Frontend (React): Consumes the exposed APIs to display and manage data
